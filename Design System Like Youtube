1-) INTRODUCING

- Firstly we should cover some of the important issues. Firstly, we should clarify the system design very well. Additionally we can determine
the type of databases (NoSql or RDBMS) and limitiations of limit be carefully

- Like youtube, this system provides users to share or watch video on cloud platform. Additionally, user can make comment or get the point
to video or fallow the other users when using this cloud web application.

2-) REQUIREMENTS AND GOALS OF THE SYSTEM

- There are three types of requirements. These are functional, nonfunctional and extended requirements.

- Functional requirements
  
  i-) User can login and logout
  ii-) User can upload videos and share videos
  iii-) User can watch videos 
  iv-) User can give the rate of videos.
  v-) User can like or dislike the photos.
  vi-) Users can see the watching number of video.
  vii-) User can add or view comments.
  
 - Nonfunctional requirements
 
  i-) System should be highly reliable, this means that uploading videos cannot be losted. This necessity can be provided by using the repli
  ii-) System should be highly avaliable. This means that user should reach the system whenever you want. Also system should have a 
  minimum latency. Notice that we can choose the CAP Theorem when designing the system, so this system will be acceptable if some of videos 
  does not be seen for a while. (Notice that this is partition tolerance, system should always work.)
