1-) What is system looks like?

  * This software is an application that users can comminicate between other users (whether they are friends or not). This means that users can send message or limited 
  files for other users. Notice that in a message sytem, one to one conservation or group conservation should be supported. As explained
  later, system should be reliable and send response with minimum latency. (also availabity). Additionally users should use this sytem in any
  platform. (desktop or mobile or etc..)
  
2-) Goals and Requirements

 * There are 3 types of requirements should define for developing this system.
 
   i-) Functional requirements
     - User should send messages or limited files to other users.
     - Users should see the all conservation tabs from their platform.
     - Users should see the old conservations (in old messages area)
     - Users should see who is online or who is offline in platform
  
   ii-) Non functional requirements
    - System should be highly available. This means that users should reach the system 
    whenever they want. We can prefer more servers for developing system. 
    - System should return requests with minimum latency. This means that when users send a message to other user, this message should
    reach as fast as possible. (This property can be provided with data partition and again with more servers)
    - System can be reliable. This means that data loosing is not a good thing. We can do the replication. Notice that for one shard
    the suitable replicate shard number is 2 or more. Additionally, system can be tolerance for consistency.
    
   iii-) Extended requirements
    - REST API can be used to developing this system.
    - Additionally we can use push notification services for seeing message when coming new message. Amazon SNS service
    or OneSignal can be preferred for notifications. (OneSignal free, AWS SNS not free) 
    - System can be monitorize.
    
  3-) Capacity estimation
  
    * In this systen, we suppose that 100 Million active users in one day, and each users end average 30 new messages in a day. This means 
    that (If we think that each message is 100 bytes)
    
    Storage estimate in one day : 100M * 30 new message *  100 bytes = 3 * 10^11 Byte = 300 GB 
    Storage estimate in 10 years : 300 GB * 365 * 10 = (approximately) 1 PB (huge data).
    Notice that this estimation is only for chat data. This does not include metadata(user information, chat data information) 
    and replications.
    
    * For bandwith estimation; 
    300 GB / (24 * 3600) = (approximately 5 MB) => (For both upload and download)
    
  4-) Think about high level design
  
   * A sends a message to B through the server.
   * The server receives the message and sends an acknowledgment to A.
   * The server stores the message in its database and sends the message to B.
   * B gets the message and sends the acknowledgment to the server.
   * The server notifies A that the message has been delivered successfully to User-B.
